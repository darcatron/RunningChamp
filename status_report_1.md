Comments by Ming:
* "Database storage, hashing of passwords, session tokens, encrypted HTTPS support" --hot dang, that a lot of stuff accomplished.  Have you all, or someone, done this before?
* "Reasoning about how storage of sensitive data is stored and transferred from client to server" --my advice: the less data you store, the better (think privacy).
